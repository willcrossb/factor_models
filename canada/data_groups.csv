The BOS underlying indicator is re-estimated every quarter following the release of the Business Outlook Survey (results are available on the Bank website). As such, the entire time series is revised after every release.  The date field refers to the first day of the quarter where the BOS underlying indicator is estimated. For example, 01/04/2016 refers to the 2016Q2 estimate, which is available roughly one week after the end of the quarter (e.g. mid-July 2016).
